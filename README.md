## ‚ú® Features

### Current Features
- **Random Title Selection**: Scans your SD card and randomly picks from installed titles
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically filters out system titles and non-game content (categories 0x00 and 0x02 only)
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - `A` - Launch the selected title
  - `Y` - Reroll for a different random title
  - `START` - Exit the application
- **Real-time Display**: Shows the selected title ID and provides feedback during rerolls
- **Error Handling**: Displays error codes if title scanning fails

### How It Works
The application uses the 3DS Application Manager (AM) service to:
1. Scan for all titles installed on the SD card
2. Filter titles by content category to exclude system applications
3. Randomly select from the filtered list
4. Use the APT (Application) service to chain-load the selected title

## üî® Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) development environment
- devkitARM toolchain
- 3ds-dev libraries

### Build Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/einso/3ds-randomtitlepicker.git
   cd 3ds-randomtitlepicker
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. The compiled `.3dsx` file will be created in the project root

### Development Setup
For development, you may want to set up:
- A 3DS emulator (Citra) for testing
- A physical 3DS with CFW for final testing
- Git hooks for code formatting (optional)

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Language**: C
- **Framework**: libctru (3DS homebrew library)
- **Services Used**:
  - `gfx` - Graphics rendering
  - `am` - Application Manager (title scanning)
  - `apt` - Application (title launching)
  - `hid` - Input handling

### Key Components
- **Title Scanning**: Uses `AM_GetTitleList()` to enumerate SD card titles
- **Content Filtering**: Filters by content category to exclude system titles
- **Random Selection**: Uses `rand()` with time-based seeding
- **Chain Loading**: Uses `aptSetChainloader()` to launch selected titles

### Code Structure
```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c          # Main application logic
```

### Dependencies
- libctru (3DS homebrew library)
- Standard C library functions
